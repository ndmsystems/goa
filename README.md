# Goa

The purpose of the library is to hide low-level communication with channels using the model of actors.
The ideas from [Erlang OTP] were taken as a basis.

Goa allows you

  - Create processes and communicate with them using asynchronous or synchronous messages
  - Establish two-way relation between processes using links
  - Establish one-way relation between processes using monitors
